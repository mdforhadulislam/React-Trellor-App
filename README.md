This application acts as a project management app, like the trellor application. First, you need to add your board, then you choose your board name and a color for your board's background. You can add multiple types of boards. If you want, you can change the name of the board and delete the board. After that, if you click on any board, another page will open and you can add more than one list to it. Again, if you want, you can add tasks inside each list and you can also delete tasks. If you want you can delete the list on a board and then change the name of the list. You can take a list to another board and copy and paste a list to another board if you want.
